For this project, we will need html file and js(javascript) file.
Javascript is language mostly used for web devs.
To run javascript we would need a webpage, or a html file.

Sample html file is included in here. We don't have to know so much about html, because we are just going to run game.js, but if you want to take a look, you can do so.

game.js is javascript file, and we will be mostly focusing on this.
